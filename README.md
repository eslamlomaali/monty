## Data Structures:

LIFO, FIFO Stacks and Queues<br>
Monty project<br>
Done by Eslam and Youssef<br>
A stack is filled using push()<br>
And it is getting empty using pop()<br>
Top of the stack is the last element pushed in it<br>
Top is also the first element being popped<br>
Queue is another data structure where the first<br>
Element pushed is the first one popped<br>
